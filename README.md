## üöÄ Mission: Accelerate Everything

In a world where every second counts, ColdWheels is the ultimate pit stop for developers building next-generation automotive applications. We provide a robust, secure, and ridiculously fast backend, so you can focus on what matters: building stunning user experiences that move people.

## ‚ú® Why ColdWheels is Your Unfair Advantage:

*   **Blazing-Fast Performance:** Built with Go (Golang), Gin, and a PostgreSQL backend, ColdWheels is engineered for speed. Say goodbye to sluggish APIs and hello to instant gratification.
*   **Rock-Solid Security:** We've integrated JWT-based authentication and Argon2 password hashing to keep your users' data locked down tighter than a lug nut.
*   **Infinite Scalability:** With our S3-compatible image upload and presigned URL generation, you can handle a virtually unlimited number of high-resolution images without breaking a sweat.
*   **Effortless Integration:** A clean, RESTful API and CORS support make it a breeze to connect your frontend, whether it's a web app, mobile app, or a VR showroom.
*   **Developer-First Experience:** We've done the heavy lifting so you don't have to. With a straightforward setup and clear documentation, you'll be up and running in minutes.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack: A Symphony of Power and Precision

*   **Go (Golang):** The heart of our engine, providing raw speed and concurrency.
*   **Gin:** A high-performance HTTP web framework for crafting elegant APIs.
*   **GORM:** The fantastic ORM library for Go, making database interactions a joy.
*   **PostgreSQL:** The world's most advanced open-source relational database.

*   **Argon2:** A state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm.
*   **Docker:** For seamless containerization and deployment.

## üèÅ Get Started in 60 Seconds

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silverstone-git/coldwheels-backend.git
cd coldwheels-backend
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.production` file in the root directory. You can copy the example if it exists:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
```
Populate it with your configuration. See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section for details.

### 3. Docker Network
Create the required Docker network:
```bash
docker network create --ipv6 --subnet 2001:db8::/64 my_ipv6_network
```

### 4. Launch!

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to get up and running.
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Using Docker Run
If you prefer a manual approach:
```bash
# First, build the image
docker build -t wheelsimg .

# Then, run the container
docker run --env-file .env.production --name wheelc --network my_ipv6_network -d -p 4054:4054 wheelsimg
```
